# Hyper-lethal (name subject to change)
This project is a continuation of the Capsher game jam. This version is a complete overhaul of most of the code base and serves as a final prototype before I migrate to Unity. I may update this repository in the future to include more commentary in the code in case someone wants to use it, but aside from that I have no intention of maintaining this repo.

# End goal
Hyper-lethal will be a roguelite space adventure game designed with elements pulled from two of my favorite games, Nova Drift and Risk of Rain 2.
